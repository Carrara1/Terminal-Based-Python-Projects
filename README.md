# Python Terminal-based Projects
---

Projects I did while improving my python.
This is a menu to access a bunch of projects, but you can get the individual files as well

Most of this projects are pretty simple and probably janky, so be aware of that! :)

## So far this includes:

- Password Generator
- BMI Calculator
- Rock Paper Scissors
- Pizza Delivery 
- Tip Calculator
- Band Name Generator 
- Leap Year Checker 7
- Simple RPG
- Treasure Map
