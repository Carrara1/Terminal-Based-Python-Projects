# Python Terminal-based Projects
---
(currently redoing the menu system)


Projects I did while improving my python.
There's a menu to access it all, but you can get the individual files as well

Most of this projects are pretty simple, be aware of that! :)

## So far this includes:

- Password Generator
- BMI Calculator
- Rock Paper Scissors
- Pizza Delivery 
- Tip Calculator
- Band Name Generator 
- Leap Year Checker 
- Simple RPG
- Treasure Map


## Missing: 
- Hangman
- Caesar Cipher
